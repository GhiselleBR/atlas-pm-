## 🛠 How I Built It

### Process
1. **Research**: Identified pain points from PO interviews
2. **Design**: Defined 4 core functionalities
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Crafted structured prompts for each feature
4. **Testing**: Validated with 15+ real use cases
5. **Iteration**: Refined based on output quality

### Tech Stack
- **Platform**: Poe.com (no-code bot builder)
- **AI Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet → GPT-4o-Mini
- **Technique**: Advanced prompt engineering
- **Design**: Conversational UX principles

### Timeline
- **Total time**: ~15 hours over 1 week
- **Focus**: Product thinking > technical complexity

## 📚 Key Learnings

💡 **Prompt engineering is critical**  
Output quality directly depends on prompt structure and clarity

💡 **Testing with real scenarios matters**  
Theoretical prompts ≠ real use cases

💡 **Conversational UX is product design**  
How the bot asks questions is as important as answers

💡 **Constraints drive creativity**  
Platform limitations forced optimization for highest-impact features

💡 **Product thinking > tech complexity**  
Value comes from solving real problems, not fancy tech

## 📊 Hypothetical Impact

If this were a production product, success metrics would include:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time saved per task | 60% reduction |
| Adoption rate | 70% of POs using weekly |
| Quality score | 4.5+ / 5.0 |
| Return rate | 80% weekly active users |
